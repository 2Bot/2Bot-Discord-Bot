## Preface

First to get a few things out of the way:  

- [Here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=301819949683572738&scope=bot&permissions=11264) is the link to invite 2Bot to your server.  
- [Here](https://discord.gg/9T34Y6u) is a link to the support server, for support amongst other things.
- [Read the wiki](https://github.com/Strum355/2Bot-Discord-Bot/wiki) to learn more about 2Bot! Updated sometimes.
- If you ever run into problems with the bot, or have any questions, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Strum355/2Bot-Discord-Bot/issues) or join the support server.

A command to automatically submit issues coming soon.
